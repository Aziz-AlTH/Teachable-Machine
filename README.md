 Project Title: Image Classification with TensorFlow SavedModel (Trained via Teachable Machine)
This project demonstrates how to use a TensorFlow SavedModel, exported from Google's Teachable Machine, to perform image classification using Python. The model is trained with at least two classes and is capable of predicting the class of a given input image.
Model Info
Model Source: Teachable Machine

Framework: TensorFlow SavedModel

Input size: 224x224 RGB

Classes: 2+ (custom-trained)

Export Format: TensorFlow â†’ SavedModel

Evaluation
The model was evaluated by testing on known samples. Prediction accuracy depends on training quality and input clarity. Confidence scores indicate model certainty in its classification.

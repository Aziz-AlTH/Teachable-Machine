# Teachable-Machine
This project uses Google Teachable Machine to create an image classification model with at least two different classes. The trained model is exported in TensorFlowâ€™s SavedModel format and used in a Python script running in Google Colab. The script loads the model, preprocesses an input image, and predicts its class label and confidence score.
